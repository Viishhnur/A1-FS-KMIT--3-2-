/*
 * A chat application stores each message with:
    • user ID (String)
    • message content (String)
    • timestamp (Instant)

Write a program that:
    1. Counts how many messages each user has sent.
    2. Determines each user’s last-seen time (the most recent timestamp).
    3. Sorts all users by:
         a. last-seen timestamp, newest first
         b. then by message count, highest first
    4. Prints the top three users by this combined ordering.
    
    
Expected Output:
----------------
Top 3 active users: [bob, alice, carol]
