# üßµ Java Singleton Pattern ‚Äî Double-Checked Locking Explained

## üìå What is Double-Checked Locking?

Double-Checked Locking is a design pattern used in **multithreaded** environments to reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first checking the condition **without synchronization**, and only synchronizing if the condition might still be true.

This pattern is often used when implementing the **Singleton Design Pattern**, where only **one instance** of a class should exist throughout the application.

## ‚úÖ Proper Singleton with Double-Checked Locking

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton obj;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance2() {
        if (obj == null) { // First check - no locking
            synchronized (Singleton.class) { // Class-level lock
                if (obj == null) { // Second check - inside lock
                    System.out.println("if block");
                    obj = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        } else {
            System.out.println("else block");
        }
        return obj;
    }
}
```

## ‚ùì Why Two `null` Checks?

| Check                        | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `if (obj == null)`          | First check avoids locking if instance is already created (performance). |
| `if (obj == null)` inside lock | Ensures only one thread initializes the singleton, even if multiple threads reach the first check simultaneously. |

‚ö†Ô∏è Without the second check inside the synchronized block, **multiple instances** could be created under high concurrency.

## üîê Class-Level Locking vs. Object-Level Locking

### üî∑ Class-Level Locking

```java
synchronized (Singleton.class)
```

- Locks on the **Class object**, not on an instance.
- Used when **synchronizing static members or methods**.
- Applies to all threads accessing static members of the class.

üìç In Singleton pattern, this is **essential** because we don‚Äôt have an instance before it is created.

---

### üî∂ Object-Level Locking

```java
synchronized (this)
```

or

```java
public synchronized void someMethod() { }
```

- Locks on the **current instance** of the object.
- Used to **synchronize access to instance-level fields**.
- Each object has its own lock.

üìç This doesn‚Äôt help in Singleton initialization since the instance does not exist yet.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Use `volatile` Keyword

```java
private static volatile Singleton obj;
```

- Prevents **instruction reordering** issues during object creation.
- Ensures that when a thread writes to `obj`, the updated value is immediately visible to other threads.

---

## ‚ùå Bad Singleton Example (Not Thread Safe)

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton obj;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (obj == null) {
            obj = new Singleton(); // Not thread-safe
        }
        return obj;
    }
}
```

### ‚ùå Problem:
- Multiple threads can enter the `if (obj == null)` block at the same time and create **multiple instances**, breaking the Singleton principle.

---

## ‚úÖ Good Singleton Example (Thread Safe & Efficient)

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton obj;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (obj == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (obj == null) {
                    obj = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return obj;
    }
}
```

- Uses `volatile` to ensure visibility.
- Uses **double-checked locking** to reduce synchronization overhead.
- Only locks when needed.

| `synchronized (Class.class)` | Class-level locking for static members.                             |
| `volatile` keyword        | Prevents memory consistency issues.                                    |
