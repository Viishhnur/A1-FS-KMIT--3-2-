/*
A text editor application allows users to perform automated corrections in documents. 
The feature scans the document and replaces every distinct instance of a specified incorrect phrase with a 
corrected one.
However, to avoid infinite loops and ambiguity, the editor replaces only non-overlapping occurrences of the phrase 
from left to right, one at a time.

Input Format:
-------------------------  
Line-1: A string `S` representing the original word
Line-2: A string `P` representing the pattern to be replaced
Line-3: A string `R` representing the replacement phrase (Special character) 

Output Format:
-------------------------
A string with all non-overlapping occurrences of `P` in `S` replaced with `R`

Example
--------
Input:
word = "ABCABCXABC";
pattern = "ABC";
ch = '@';
Explanation:
Original string:  A B C A B C X A B C
                  [ABC] [ABC]   [ABC] â†’ all 3 are non-overlapping
Output:@ @ X @

Sample Input:
-------------------- 
ABABABAB
AB
@
Sample Output:
-----------------------
@@@@
