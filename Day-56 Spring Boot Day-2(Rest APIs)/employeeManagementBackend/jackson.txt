Who is Jackson?

Jackson is a popular Java library for processing JSON data â€” that means:

    Parsing JSON strings into Java objects (deserialization)

    Converting Java objects back into JSON strings (serialization)

It's one of the most widely used JSON libraries in the Java ecosystem and comes integrated by default in Spring Boot.
Why is Jackson important in Spring?

    When you use @RequestBody in a Spring controller to accept JSON input, Spring uses Jackson behind the scenes to convert that JSON into your Java class instance.

    When you return a Java object from a controller, Spring uses Jackson to convert it back to JSON in the HTTP response.

Key features of Jackson:

    Supports POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) with getters/setters.

    Can work with no-arg constructors or parameterized constructors (with annotations).

    Supports advanced features like custom serializers/deserializers.

    Works seamlessly with Spring Boot and is usually auto-configured.

Example:

{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25
}

This JSON sent to Spring controller gets converted to:

public class Person {
  private String name;
  private int age;

  // getters and setters
}

Jackson handles this conversion automatically
